    <h3>March 30, 1853 - July 29, 1890</h3>
        <p>Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks.They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits; and are characterized by bold, symbolic colors, and dramatic, impulsive and highly expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Only one of his paintings was known by name to have been sold during his lifetime. Van Gogh became famous after his suicide, aged 37, which followed years of poverty and mental illness.</p>

    <h3>Artistic Development</h3>
        <p>Van Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survives, and the authorship of some has been challenged. For more than a year, he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognized as early masterpieces. <br><br> From early 1883, he worked `on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known Hague School artists like Weissenbruch and Blommers, and he received technical advice from them as well as from painters like De Bock and Van der Weele- both of the Hague School's second generation. He was aware many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise. In November 1885, he traveled to Antwerp, and later to Paris to learn and develop his skills. 
        <br><br> 
        Van Gogh perceived color as having a "psychological and moral weight", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of The Night Café- a work he wanted to "express the terrible passions of humanity". Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolized emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God. 
        <br><br>
        Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature. During his first summer in Arles, he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use of traditional Christian iconography, he made up his own where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower. 
        <br><br> 
        Van Gogh stayed within what he called the "guise of reality" and was critical of overly stylized works. He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of Starry Night had gone too far and that reality had "receded too far in the background”. 
        <br><br> 
        Van Gogh appears to have been building an oeuvre, a collection that reflected his personal vision and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of color, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word "purposeful" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies. The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre: those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower, Night Cafe, Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colors, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.</p>

    <h2 id="Death">Death</h2>
        <p>On July 27th, 1890 at the age of 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or in a local barn. Van Gogh was buried on July 30th, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. There have been numerous debates as to the nature of Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. His condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.</p>

    <h2 id="Reputation-and-Legacy">Reputation and Legacy</h2>
        <p>After Van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors. In 1887, André Antoine hung Van Gogh's alongside works of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris. In 1889, his work was described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by Albert Aurier as characterized by "fire, intensity, sunshine". Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890. French president Marie François Sadi Carnot was said to have been impressed by Van Gogh's work. 
        <br><br> 
        After Van Gogh's death, memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at Les XX; in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels. In 1892, Octave Mirbeau wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an "infinitely sadder loss for art ... even though the populace has not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived."</p>

    <h3>Van Gogh Museum</h3>
        <p>The Van Gogh Museum opened in the Museumplein in Amsterdam in 1973. It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands, after the Rijksmuseum, regularly receiving more than 1.5 million visitors a year. In 2015, it had a record of 1.9 million, where 85% of the visitors came to visit from other countries.</p>
